Hi my name is mudit and i would love to interact with the pdf reader.

Nice to meet you, Mudit! I'm happy to help you explore 
the world of PDF readers. What kind of interaction are 
you looking for? Do you want to:

1. **Test a specific PDF file** with me?
2. **Learn about different PDF reading features**, 
such as annotations, bookmarks, or search 
functionality?
3. **Get recommendations for popular PDF reader 
software**, like Adobe Acrobat, Foxit Reader, or 
SumatraPDF?
4. **Discuss advanced topics**, like OCR (Optical 
Character Recognition), PDF editing, or security 
settings?

Feel free to pick any of these options or suggest 
something else that's on your mind!
